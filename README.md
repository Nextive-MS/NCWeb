# NCWeb
Safari, meet anywhere.
Ever feel that Multitasking is nonexistant on iPhones? well your in luck. This is NCWeb. A Web Browser, in the Notification Center. Using an SFSafariViewController I made it so that you can browse anywhere in the web. The only limitations? There are a lot. You MUST paste in order to browse, as text fields don't work in a system overlay, that is above the keyboard's layer. Besides that there are a few fun bugs, so have fun :P .
